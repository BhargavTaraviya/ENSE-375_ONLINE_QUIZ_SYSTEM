# <a name="_toc43885122"></a>**1. Introduction**
- This project focuses on designing and developing the Interactive Quiz System, a Java-based application for creating and managing quizzes. Our goal is to simplify the process of quiz administration so users can take and manage quizzes easily. Since traditional paper quizzes are time-consuming for feedback, and hard to save for long time, we are motivated to provide this quiz system for effective quiz management that benefits users. 
- The following sections will cover problem definition, design requirements and solutions. Finally, there is a conclusion and ideas for future work.

## <a name="_toc43885124"></a>2.1 Problem Definition
### **Problems for Ineffective Quiz Management:**

**1. Inconvenience:** Traditional paper-based quizzes require significant time and efforts for distribution and evaluation. \
**2. Limited Accessibility:** Traditional methods do not support easy access and management of quizzes from remote locations, which can be lost somewhere easily. \
**3. Complexity of Existing Solutions:** Many existing digital solutions are overly complex and not user-friendly. \

### **Benefits of an Digital Solution:** 

**1. Improved Efficiency:** A digital system can automate quiz creation, distribution, and evaluation, saving time and effort. 
**2. User-Friendly Interface:** A straightforward interface makes it easier for users to manage quizzes. 
**3. Remote Accessibility:** Users can access and manage quizzes from any location, facilitating remote learning. 

### **Rationale** 

It was evident that there is a need for this project through the various issues related to the difficulties of using traditional approaches, as well as managing digital quiz packages and tools that are currently available. A wide range of users will benefit from improved management of quizzes provided by the Interactive Quiz System, which focuses on a simple, efficient, and accessible service. Our system avoids the major drawbacks of purely paper-based systems and complex electronic systems. It maintains the productivity of a system without some redundant features.
