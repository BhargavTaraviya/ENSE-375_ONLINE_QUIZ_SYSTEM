## Project Title
Interactive Quiz System

## Project Description:

This project focuses on designing and developing the Interactive Quiz System, a Java-based application for creating and managing quizzes. The goal is to simplify the process of quiz administration by providing a user-friendly platform suitable for a wide range of users. The motivation for this project comes from the need for an accessible and straightforward tool that facilitates effective quiz management. Traditional paper-based quizzes are often cumbersome and time-consuming, while many existing digital solutions can be overly complex.
